\section{Microphones}
Microphones convert sound energy to a changing electric current (a signal).
Main classes of microphones:
\subsection{Dynamic (moving coil) Mics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Low sensitivity because a lot of sound energy is required to move the heavy coil.
\item Usually a very uneven frequency response.
\item Durable - suited to live sound re-enforcement or recording of very loud instruments.
\item Cheap
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Condenser (capacitor) Mics}
\begin{itemize}
\item High sensitivity
\item Usually a flatter frequency response
\item Delicate and expensive - damaged very easily so often avoided for live sound re-enforcement.
\item Back Electret - cheaper and usually lower quality then condenser
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Condenser}\caption{Condenser microphone}
\label{fig:condenser}
\end{figure}

In a typical condenser mic the diaphragm is a very thin circular plate of metal that is free to move. Directly behind the moving plate is a second plate that is fixed. As the moving plate moves due to changes in sound pressure the distance between the plates changes. The two plates form a capacitor (an electronic component that stores charge) and some electronics in the mic turn changing capacitance into changing current (a signal). The electronics needed by the mic require a small amount of power. This is usually provided by phantom power from the preamp (+48v) but can sometimes be a battery in the mic.

\subsection{Ribbon}
\begin{itemize}
\item High sensitivity
\item Usually a flatter frequency response
\item Very expensive and vintage technology.
\item very delicate
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

Ribbon mics are very expensive and not that commonly seen but they are usually used when you need a very sensitive pickup. Acoustic instruments etc.

\subsection{Frequency Response}
Microphones and speakers respond differently to specific frequencies.
This response can be shown in a graph of level over frequency.
Sometimes we are interested in a `flat' frequency response. (the unit responds equally to as many frequencies as possible)
Studio loudspeakers almost always aim for the flattest frequency response. Generally this is desirable in a mic as well.
Sometimes we are interested in a characteristic frequency response. (the unit colours the sound by emphasizing or filtering certain frequencies)
Dynamic mics often colour the sound, certain vocal mics aim to produce 'warmer' tones. These mics offer creative possibilities.

\subsection{Polar Patterns}
Microphones have an associated polar pickup pattern. In reality this is frequency dependent (see below) but it is usually generalized into the following:

Omni-directional (equal response in all directions)

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Omni}\caption{Omnidirectional pattern}
\label{fig:omni}
\end{figure}

Cardioid (weighted response from one direction)

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Cardioid}\caption{Cardioid pattern}
\label{fig:cardioid}
\end{figure}

Hyper-Cardioid (more extreme directional variations) (no picture)

Figure eight (bidirectional pickup response, used in M/S pair see below)
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figureofeight}\caption{Figure 8 pattern}
\label{fig:figure8}
\end{figure}

In reality these pickup patterns extend in 3 dimensions. The following picture highlights this.
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Cardioid3d}\caption{3d cardioid pattern}
\label{fig:3dpattern}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Polar representation of frequency response}

Microphones and loudspeakers have directional characteristics. (They respond differently in different directions)
Most microphone manufacturers provide polar response charts.
Good interactive one at: \href{http://www.neumann.com/?lang=en&id=current_microphones&cid=km180_data#}{Neumann Website}
Learning to read these charts is useful. the following is the frequency response of the D112 kick drum mic.

\section{Capturing a spatial image}
In a recording we will want to recreate the sense of space that was present in the source. We also need to present the recordings through a medium that can reproduce the sense of space. Typically the process is generalised into the term spatial encoding/decoding. We would say that a recording is spatially encoded in stereo, M/S or b-format.

\subsection{Spatial encoding}
Some examples of spatial encoding formats.
\begin{itemize}
\item mono (1 channel)
\item stereo (2 channel, X/Y pair)
\item stereo (2 channel, A/B pair)
\item stereo (2 channel, M/S pair)
\item 4 channel (quad)
\item 4 channel (b-format encoded)
\item 5.1 (5 full range channels and a low frequency effects channel LFE )
\item 7.1 (7 full range channels and a low frequency effects channel LFE )
\item 10.2 (2 * 5.1 rigs at differing altitude)
\item 8 channel (cubic array)
\item 8 channel (circle array)
\end{itemize}

On this course we mainly work in stereo.



\subsection{Stereo capture techniques}

Spaced pair (A/B pair) mics are spaced apart across the sound field

Coincident pair (X/Y pair)

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Xypair}\caption{XY pair}
\label{fig:xypair}
\end{figure}

A/B or ORTF pair, mics spaced 17cm apart at 110 degrees

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Ortfpair}\caption{ORTF pair}
\label{fig:ortfpair}
\end{figure}

Middle and Side M/S pair
M/S pairs are suited to broadcast because they can be converted to mono without phase cancellations. With this format the spatial information is encoded and must be decoded with the mixer (see diagram) or with a dedicated M/S decoder.

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:midsidepair}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Ambisonics}
Ambisonics is a method of capturing the sound in such a way as to preserve as much of the spatial image as possible. The sound is recorded with a special microphone (a sound field mic) and encoded to a 'B-format' stream. The B-format consists of 4 channels: named W, X, Y, and Z. B-format streams can be decoded with some fairly complex mathematics into any arbitrary playback array. So if you have a stereo speaker set it can be decoded to stereo. If you have a home cinema system it can be decoded into 5.1.

To decode into stereo:
\begin{verbatim} 
R = 0.7071 * W + 0.5 * Y
L = 0.7071 * W + -0.5 * Y
\end{verbatim}

To decode into quad:
\begin{verbatim}
R = 0.3536 * W + 0.3536 * X + 0.3536 * Y
L = 0.3536 * W + 0.3536 * X + -0.3536 * Y
RL = 0.3536 * W + -0.3536 * X + 0.3536 * Y
RR = 0.3536 * W + -0.3536 * X + -0.3536 * Y
\end{verbatim}

Ambisonics is used mainly in research, particularly the research of spatial sound. The following shows a closeup view of the Soundfield mic capsule and a polar plot of the pickup response of a B-Format stream.
