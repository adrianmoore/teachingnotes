1. Moondrunk & 2. Colombine \\\hline
The wine that through the eyes is drunk, & The moonlight's pallid blossoms, \\ 
at night the moon pours down in torrents, & the white and wondrous roses, \\
until a spring-flood overflows & bloom in July's nights-\\
the silent far horizon. & oh, could I pluck but one-\\
Desires, shuddering and sweet, & My heavy load to lighten, \\
are swimming through the flood unnumbered- & in darkling streams I search for \\
The wine that through the eyes is drunk, & the moonlight's pallid blossoms,\\
at night the moon pours down in torrents.& the white and wondrous roses.\\ 
The poet, whom devotion drives, & Then stilled were all my yearning,\\
grows tipsy on the sacred liquor, & could I, as in a fable, \\
to heaven turning his enraptured gaze & so tenderly - but scatter \\
and reeling, sucks and slurps up & upon your brown tresses \\
the wine that through the eyes  is drunk.& the moonlight's pallid blossoms-\\\hline
 
3 The Dandy & 4 A Pallid Laundrymaid\\\hline
And with a fantastical light-beam & See a pallid laundrymaid \\
the moon sheds a light on the crystalline flask & washing nightly faded linen;\\
on the ebony, highly sacred washstand & naked, silver-whitish arms\\
of the taciturn dandy from Bergamo.& stretching downward in the flood.\\
In sonorous, bronzen basin& Through the clearing gentle breezes\\
laughs brightly the fountain's metallical cry.& lightly ruffle up the stream.\\
And with a fantastical light-beam & See a pallid laundrymaid\\
the moon sheds a light on the crystalline flask.& washing nightly faded linen.\\
Pierrot with waxen complexion & And the tender maid of heaven,\\
stands musing and thinks: what makeup for today?& by the branches softly fondled,\\
Rejecting the red and the orient green & lays out on the darkling meadows \\
he bedizens his face in a high noble style & all her linen woven of moonbeams- \\
and with a fantastical moonbeam. & see a pallid laundrymaid.\\\hline


5 Valse de Chopin & 6 Madonna\\\hline
As a pallid drop of blood& Rise, O Mother of all Sorrows,\\
stains the lips of a consumptive,& on the altar of my verses- \\
so there lurks within this music& Blood pours forth from withered bosom\\
morbid soul-destructive charm.& where the cruel sword has pierced it.\\
Wild accords of passion& And thine ever-bleeding wounds\\
breaking desperation's icy dream& seem like eyes, red and open.\\
as a pallid drop of blood& Rise, O Mother of all Sorrows\\
stains the lips of a consumptive.& on the alter of my verses-\\
Fierce, triumphant, sweet and yearning,& In the torn and wasted hands\\
melancholy sombre waltzing,& holding the Son's holy body,\\
you will never leave my senses,& thou revealst Him to all mankind -\\
cling to each thought as I think it,& but the eyes of men are turned away,\\
as a pallid drop of blood-& O Mother of all Sorrows-\\\hline

7 The Sick Moon& 8 Night\\\hline
O sombre deathly-stricken moon& Black gigantic butterflies \\ 
lying on heaven's dusky pillow& have blotted out the shining sun. \\
your stare, so wide-eyed, feverish,& Like a sorcerer's sealed book, \\
charms me, like far-off melody.& the horizon sleeps in silence. \\
Of unappeasable pain of love & From the murky depths forgotten \\
you die, of yearning, choked to death.& vapours rise, to murder memory-  \\
O sombre deathly-stricken moon& Black gigantic butterflies \\
lying on heaven's dusky pillow.& have blotted out the shining sun. \\
The lover, with his heart aflame,& And from heaven toward the earth, \\
who heedless goes to meet his love,& sinking down on heavy pinions, \\
rejoices in your play of light,& all unseen descend the monsters \\
your pallid, pain-begotten blood,& to the hearts of men below here... \\
O sombre deathly-stricken moon-& Black gigantic butterflies. \\\hline

9 Prayer to Pierrot & 10 Theft \\\hline
Pierrot- my laughter& Redly gleaming princely rubies, \\
have I unlearnt- & bleeding drops of ancient glory \\
The dram of radiance& slumber in the dead men's coffins, \\
dispersed, dispersed-& buried in the vaults below us. \\
Black waves the banner& Nights, alone with his companions, \\
upon the mast.& Pierrot descends, to plunder \\
Pierrot- My laughter& redly gleaming princely rubies, \\
have I unlearned-& bleeding drops of ancient glory. \\
O now return to me,& Then suddenly they're rooted, \\
soul's veterinarian,& scared to death, hair standing straight up: \\
Snowman of Lyric,& through the darkness, like eyes \\
Your Lunar Highness,& staring from the dead men's coffins -  \\
Pierrot- - my laughter-& redly gleaming princely rubies. \\\hline


11 Red Mass& 12 Gallows Song\\\hline
To gruesome grim communion, & The haggard harlot\\
by blinding golden glitter,& whose neck is scrawny\\
by flickering shine of candles,& will be the last\\
comes to the altar - Pierro-& of his mistresses.\\
His hand, to God devoted & And in his skull\\
tears wide the priestly vestment,& she'll stick like a needle,\\
At gruesome grim communion,& the haggard harlot\\
by blinding golden glitter.& whose neck is scrawny.\\
He makes the sign of the cross& Slim as a pine tree,\\
blessing the trembling, trembling people,& she has a pigtail,\\
with trickling crimson wafer:& gaily she'll bind it\\
his heart in bloody fingers,& around his neck,\\
at gruesome grim communion.& the haggard harlot-\\\hline

13 Beheading& 14 The Crosses\\\hline
The moon, a shining Turkish sword& Holy crosses are the verses\\
upon a black and silken cushion,& whereon poets bleed in silence,\\
and spectral vast hangs like a threat & blinded by a flock of vultures\\
in sorrow-darkened night-& fluttering round in spectral swarms.\\
Pierrot restlessly roams about& In their bodies swords have feasted,\\
and stares on high in deathly fear& glorying in their robes of scarlet- \\
at the moon, a shining Turkish sword& Holy crosses are the verses\\
upon a black and silken cushion.& whereon poets bleed in silence.\\
And shaking, quaking at the knees,& Dead, the head - matted the tresses - \\
oh, suddenly he faints, collapses,& far and faint the noisy people.\\
convinced that there comes whistling down& Slowly sinks the sun in splendour,\\
upon his sinful guilty neck& like a crimson kingly crown.\\
the moon, a shining Turkish sword.& Holy crosses are the verses.\\\hline 

15 Nostalgia& 16 Mean Trick \\\hline
Sweet lamenting, like a crystal sighing,& In the gleaming skull of Cassander,\\
rises from the old Italian comedy,& as he shrieks cries blue murder,\\
sadly asking: why's Pierrot so wooden,& bores Pierrot with hypocritic kindness -\\ 
in the sentimental modern manner?& and a cranium - borer.\\
And it echoes through his heart's desert& And then presses with his finger\\
echoes mutedly through all his senses - & very genuine Turkish tobacco\\
sweet lamenting, like a crystal sighing& in the gleaming skull of Cassander,\\
rising from the old Italian comedy.& As he shrieks and cries blue murder-\\
Then Pierrot forgets his tragic manner- & Then screwing a cherry pipestem\\
Through the silver fiery glow of moonlight,& firmly in the polished surface,\\
through a flood of radiance swells his yearning,& at his ease he puffs away,\\
boldly soars on high to skies of homeland - & puffs on his genuine Turkish tobacco\\
sweet lamenting like a crystal sighing.& in the gleaming skull of Cassander-\\\hline



17 Parody& 18 The Moonfleck\\\hline
Knitting needles, brightly twinkling,& With a snowy fleck of shining moonlight\\
stuck in her graying hair,& on the back side of his smart new frockcoat,\\
sits the Duenna mumbling,& so sets forth Pierrot one balmy evening,\\
wearing ger short red dress.& in pursuit of fortune and adventure.\\
She's waiting in the arbor,& Sudden - something's wrong with his appearance,\\
she loves Pierrot with anguish.& he looks round and round and then he finds it - \\
Knitting needles, brightly twinkling,& there's a snowy fleck of shining moonlight\\
stuck in her graying hair.& on the back side of his smart new frockcoat\\
But sudden - hark - a whisper- & Hang it- thinks he: a speckle of plaster- \\
a wind-puff titters softly:& Wipes and wipes, but he can't make it vanish-\\ 
the moon, that cruel mocker,& On he goes, his pleasure has been poisoned,\\
in mimicking with moonbeams& rubs and rubs untill it's almost morning\\
knitting needles twinkling bright.& at a snowy fleck of shining moonlight.\\\hline

19 Serenade& 20 Journey Homeward (Barcarolle)\\\hline
With a bow grotesquely monstrous & A moonbeam is the rudder,\\
scrapes Pierrot on his viola.& waterlily serves as boat,\\
Like a stork on one leg standing& and so Pierrot goes southward\\
sadly plucks a pizzicato.& with friendly following wind.\\
Sudden- here's Cassander,& The stream hums scales beneath him\\
raging at the night-time virtuoso.& and rocks the fragile craft.\\
With a bow grotesquely monstrous& A moonbeam is the rudder,\\
scrapes Pierrot on his viola.& waterlily serves as boat.\\
Then he throws aside viola:& To Bergamo, his homeland,\\
with a delicate use of the left hand& at last Pierrot returns;\\
seizes Cassander by the collar - & soft glimmers rise to eastward,\\
dreaming plays upon his bald head& the green of the horizon.\\
with a bow grotesquely monstrous.& A moonbeam is the rudder.\\\hline

21 O Ancient Scent & \\\hline
O Ancient scent from fabled times,& \\
once more you captivate my senses- & \\
A merry troupe of roguish pranks& \\
pervades the gentle air.& \\
With cheerful longing I return& \\
to pleasure I too long neglected.& \\
O ancient scent from fabled times,& \\
once more you captivate  me.& \\
All of my gloom I've set aside:& \\
and from my sun-encircled window & \\
I gladly view the lovely world,& \\
and dreams go forth to greet the distance...& \\
O ancient scent from fabled times& \\\hline
