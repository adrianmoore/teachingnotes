\subsection{Post-Beethoven}
What do we have?
More literary and romantic scenes (programmes).
Carl Maria von Weber (1786-1826). Der Freisch\"utz (1821) for which he is best known (though many of his piano works are excellent). The opera has the supernatural, magic and  the devil at its heart. There are elements of surrealism (dream-like fantasy). 

Current literature included Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818).
