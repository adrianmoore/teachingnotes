\section{Michel Chion's terminology}
\begin{itemize}
\item Added Value: sound that 'naturalises' the image
\item Anempathetic sound. Sound (usually diegetic music) that plays against the plot of the film. Chion cites a scene where a radio continues to play even when the character that turned it on has died.
\item Diegetic sound is source-visible or implied by the action of the film. It can be on-screen or off-screen.
\item Non-diegetic sound is not source-visible and is usually the musical score or additional foley/sfx to the implied (diegetic) sounds.
\item Empathetic sound is usually music that is completely within the mood of the action.
\item Reduced listening: qualitative listening independent of source or meaning (also partly quantitative). Spectral listening.
\item Semantic listening: communicative content (normally language).
\item Causal listening: listing out for source or cause (normally associated with the sound of what is seen but often used to pre-figure what is about to appear). 
\item Synchresis. Relationship between audio and visual content.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Michel Chion \textit{Audio Vision} with examples}
\begin{itemize}
\item Eg 1. Bregman \textit{Persona, 1966}: Very complex sonically (and visually). Chion suggests watching the prologue with / without sound. 
\item Eg 2. Jacques Tati \textit{Mr. Hulot's Holiday}: Sonically very descriptive. 
\item Sound affecting the nature of time in a moving image. Sound may animate, it may accelerate, it may decimate. Chion suggests sound may \textit{vectorize} shots, directing time towards a goal.
\item Sound \textbf{unifies} the flow of images. It `bridges the visual breaks' \citep[p.47]{chion1990} 
\item Sound provides atmosphere, continuity, a background \textbf{and} a foreground. 
\item Sound \textbf{punctuates}
\item Sound \textbf{identifies} - the leitmotif.
\item Eg 3. Godard \textit{Lettre \`a Freddy Buache} \citep[p.56]{chion1990}. 
\item Sound - and silence (can you identify a passage in a film where silence was the key structural element?)
\item Sound and synch - the punch. 
\end{itemize}

First and last impressions. Try to spot a short clip (around 1 minute) with `appropriate' sounds (sfx that might `belong'). Spot a different 1 minute clip with sounds you think do not belong. Now try the inverse. On the clip with the inappropriate sounds try to re-balance the flow. It's more difficult than you think. This is because, unless you know the score, what you hear first often makes quite an indelible impression. \textit{Tip} when selecting a movie to score to \textit{do not} play the sound. You'll end up being a) tempted to score like that and b) not making as good a job. Do you own version then compare. For this you need to imagine the sounds you want to hear. 

Learn Chion's three zones (\citep[p.73]{chion1990}): Onscreen sound / offscreen sound / nondiegetic sound. (73/74)
One of the most important uses of a transition between zones is, for example, nondiegetic sound gradually emerging into the scene on the radio (via a filter and amplitude change). 
Learn Chion's pit music vs. screen music. (80)
Learn Chion's Active and Passive offscreen sound. (85) 
Learn Chion's meanings of Projection. (144)

\section{Understanding aspects of footage}
Basic shot types include
\begin{itemize}
\item Extreme close-up (ECU)
\item Big close-up (BCU)
\item Close-up (CU)
\item Medium close-up (MCU)
\item Medium shot (MS)
\item Medium long shot (MLS)
\item Long shot (LS)
\item Very long shot (VLS)
\item Extreme long shot (ELS)
\item Two shot (2S): two people
\item Over the shoulder (OLS)
\end{itemize}

Complex shots may involve camera movement, lens adjustment as well as tracking the subject. A complex shot may pan, tilt, zoom, focus. 

\subsection{Harmony and Counterpoint}
\begin{itemize}
\item Some interesting examples can be found online at Rick Beato's YouTube tutorials \url{https://rickbeato.com/}. 
\item Some useful explanations of jazz harmonies can be found in The Jazz Piano Book \citep{levine2011jazz}
\item A very useful orchestration pages can be found here \url{http://andrewhugill.com/OrchestraManual/}
