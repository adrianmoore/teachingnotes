Read \textit{Game sound: an introduction to the history, theory, and practice of video game music and sound design} \citep{collins2008game}

Think about the concepts of \textit{interactivity} and \textit{nonlinearity}. Two terms which might seem obvious at first but are fundamental to games yet frustrate the design of sound and music in games. 

Consider the notion of \textit{diegetic} and \textit{extradiegetic}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{diegetic} - a conscious interaction with the interface
\item \textit{extradiegetic} - a corporeal response to the gaming environment and experience. 
\end{itemize}

Consider the triggering of sounds.
